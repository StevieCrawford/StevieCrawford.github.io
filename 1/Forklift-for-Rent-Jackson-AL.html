<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>

Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>

For example a panto-graph reach forklift utilizes a scissor mechanism, allowing it to reach into racking with either a single or double reaching design. On the other hand, Europe is projected to witness significant growth in the global forklift trucks market.</p>
