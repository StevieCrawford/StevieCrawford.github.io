<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>
<p>Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. 27"W x 48"L forks feature entry rollers and tapered design for easy pallet and skid entry, and are reinforced for heavy duty loads.</p>
