<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.
