The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck.

Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>

<h2>Hydraulic Hand Pallet Trucks Effort </h2>
<p>For loads exceeding 2500kg, a motorized pallet jack, "walkie stacker" or Forklift is recommended. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. Identify the maximum load weight you need to lift, and rent a forklift that could support such capacity. The Black Widow is a professionally lifted truck by SCA Performance.</p>

<h2>Pallet Stacker Effort</h2>
<p>The U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) has guidelines in place to help forklift operators, pallet jack drivers, and other industrial powered truck workers be aware of their machine's ability to lift, maneuver, and store cargo. When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028. This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. The walkie stacker has a subtype: the order picker forklift.</p>
