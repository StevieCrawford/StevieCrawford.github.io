Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts.

Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
