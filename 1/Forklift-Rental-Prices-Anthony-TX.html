We are a well-known for manufacturing, exporting, wholesaling, distributing and supplying Electric Pallet Truck, which is an efficient product of our company.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. When it comes to forklift sales, it's important to find a reliable dealer who you can trust to provide a value-for-money solution. Manual pallet jacks have a capacity of about 5500 lbs.

Rough terrain forklifts have the build and rugged construction to handle tough outdoor work.

<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>The operator has to be aware of the forces bearing on the forklift as it turns corners. Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet. The SEAP and India Pallet Trucks market is estimated to expand at a significant CAGR in terms of value and volume over the forecast period.</p>
