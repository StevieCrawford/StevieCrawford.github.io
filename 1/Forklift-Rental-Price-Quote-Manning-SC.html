The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>

A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>
<h2>Industrial Material Lifts Manning </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
<p>If working spaces are tight and pedestrians or other trucks may cross your path, the braking system of a pallet truck must function perfectly. We carry a variety of pallet jacks, narrow aisle lift trucks, order pickers, and other cushion tire forklifts. We sell many of the leading brands of forklifts and other material handling equipment including Linde. Check your equipment before your shift because your fork lift is your responsibility, wear the proper gear, good footwear and a hard hat and enter and exit the forklift carefully.</p>
<p>We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation. Renting equipment provides a fixed monthly cost that can be written off as an operating expense, allowing you to stabilize your operating budget.</p>
