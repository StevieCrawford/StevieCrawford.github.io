<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Rating Plate: This is used to inform users of the maximum load a forklift can legally carry. This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. With FLC's counterbalance forklift certification, you're covered in case of an accident. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits.

This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.

<p>In addition, while reach trucks can be used at heights up to 40ft, this position places physical strain upon the operator's neck and eyes and so it not a recommended height for frequent use.
