<p>DaSilva says Stackers comparable to forklifts cost a little over $6,000, or half the price. We provide heavy-duty forklifts for moving your cargo.

Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
