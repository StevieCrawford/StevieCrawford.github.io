<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>Raymond forklifts offer a wide variety of operating positions that are engineered to enhance driver comfort and reduce fatigue for this specific application. We'll bring the forklift lift truck to you, and pick it up when you're done. The majority of construction contractors and suppliers of construction materials prefer the advantages of rough-terrain forklifts.</p>

In our inventory you can explore a variety of new and used electric, internal combustion, and rough terrain forklifts, as well as a number of boom lifts and floor cleaners.</p>
<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation. We will conduct a learner analysis to identify the duration of training required for those with limited or no experience, whereas experienced operators can attend a one day Experienced Worker Assessment (Test Only).</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust.
