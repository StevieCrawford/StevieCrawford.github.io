<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Travelling and manoeuvring with the machine safely over a range of terrains, including steep inclines and undulating surfaces.

<h2>Used Forklifts Or New Forklifts Get Rid Of Your Dilemma Bedford </h2>
<p>We deal with usedforklifts For Sale & Purchase also. We have multi-directional forklifts, rough terrain forklifts, straddle carriers, side loaders, and other specialty material handling equipment. You can install both a suspension lift and a body lift. Raymond stand up lift trucks are multipurpose vehicles designed to work alone or with other systems as part of a total material handling solution.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
