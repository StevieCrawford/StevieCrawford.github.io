<p>But with lift kits, the danger is a little different. Towering over most other folks on the road also provides a greater view into the distance, which is a plus when driving on regular roads and when off-roading. Airide air bag suspension springs are manufactured by Firestone for heavy truck, trailer and bus for applications such as steering axle, seat, cab mount, drive axle, lift axle, and primary trailer air suspension.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
