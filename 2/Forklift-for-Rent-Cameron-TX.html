<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for. It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
