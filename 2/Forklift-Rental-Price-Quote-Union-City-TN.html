<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution. This amount also plays a key factor in the vehicle's stability — a forklift that carries too much weight isn't stable.

<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material. If you refuel the tanks twice a day (the average for full-time use), this equates to a yearly fuel cost of $1,500 for electric, $15,000 for diesel and about $12,500 for propane. Often considered to be in a class of their own are aerial lifts , which give a single operator the ability to boom himself up to a hard-to-reach area in a man basket.” This category includes a wide variety of personnel lifts, including boom lifts and scissor lifts.</p>

<p>Free Lift = The vertical distance the forks can be raised before a mast begins to telescope. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet. The hydraulic forks spread up to 2.22 metres gives excellent possibilities to handle long loads such as steel beams and plastic pipes but also conventional pallets.

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>The counterweight on these trucks juts out much further than the next size down, resulting in a longer truck. Use only approved industrial trucks in hazardous locations. Advancements in fuel technologies has led to a proliferation of different fuel types for standard similar sized forklifts including LPG, CNG and battery electric units. A truck with a lift kit has a higher center of gravity than a stock truck from the factory.</p>
