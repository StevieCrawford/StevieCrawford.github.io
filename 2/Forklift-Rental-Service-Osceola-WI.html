Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>

These machines can also navigate fields, pastures, pens, and loading areas. The largest of the "core" line of cushion trucks, the 15,500 lb. truck has the largest counterweight and the largest lifting capacity.
