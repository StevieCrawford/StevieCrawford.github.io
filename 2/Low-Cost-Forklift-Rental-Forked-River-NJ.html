The following tests represent minimum stability requirements for order picker trucks with traction control on the lifting device, and not restrained by external means, having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 pounds at a 24 inch load center.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>
