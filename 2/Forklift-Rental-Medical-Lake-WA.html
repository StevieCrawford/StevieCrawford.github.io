<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

<p>Sfikas said all car manufacturers want to know the people who are installing the kits and ensure they are doing so without tampering with the integrity of the vehicle.

Hand-pallet trucks (aka pump trucks) are non-powered tools used to move palletised loads; typically up to 5500 lbs.</p>
<p>When leaving a powered industrial truck unattended, load engaging means shall be fully lowered, controls shall be neutralized, power shut off, brakes set, key of connector plug removed.
