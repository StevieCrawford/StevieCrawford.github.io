The following section, i.e. by region, includes the analysis of the global Pallet Trucks market on the basis of seven regions: North America, Latin America, South East Asia & Pacific, China, India, Japan, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>United Rentals was founded in 1997 and is the largest equipment rental company in the world. Items such as computers, drums, corrugated boxes, plastic bottles, furniture and beverages are examples of products which are stacked onto pallets and moved by reach trucks. Crown also introduced a number of technology enhancements to improve forklift safety.

<p>The purpose of this standard is to promote safety in the design, construction, application, operation, and maintenance of powered industrial trucks. Businesses experiencing high growth, rapid change or other factors that might introduce an element of unpredictability may benefit from a flexible rental plan. The Manitou M-Series masted” forklift range has models with lift capacities from 5,700 to 15,400 pounds, all powered by a 75-horsepower Perkins engine and available with torque-converter type or hydrostatic transmissions.</p>
