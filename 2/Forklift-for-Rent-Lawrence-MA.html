<h3>How Much Are Forklifts Lawrence MA</h3>
<p>Numerous product options, which provide the necessary load capacity and lifting heights, are also available within the reach truck series. Even if you are just going to operate a forklift one time for a specific job, OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer. If your company utilizes a very narrow aisle operation this classification of lift trucks is for you.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
