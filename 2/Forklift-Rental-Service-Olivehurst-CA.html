Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility.
