The height of these industrial reach forklifts also raises a concern about having collisions into doorways or overhead objects. We supply rental forklifts for the Napa Valley wine industry every year. The load capacity of a pallet jack is arguably the most important factor to consider before buying.</p>
<p>Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. 27"W x 48"L forks feature entry rollers and tapered design for easy pallet and skid entry, and are reinforced for heavy duty loads.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks.

Once this itemized list of goods (for example, a grocery order for a local store) is collected - usually on a motorized pallet jack - the order picker gets the pallet(s) ready for loading onto a truck.</p>
