<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>These manual pallet jacks each feature a narrow fork design with entry glides and exit rollers to help allow easier access to smaller pallets with decks up to 24"W. ReportsnReports adds Global and China Forklift Industry Report, 2018-2023 study to its online research database. Forklifts have varying abilities in each category, which must be taken into account when choosing one.</p>
