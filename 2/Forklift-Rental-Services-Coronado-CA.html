In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>These manual pallet jacks each feature a narrow fork design with entry glides and exit rollers to help allow easier access to smaller pallets with decks up to 24"W.
