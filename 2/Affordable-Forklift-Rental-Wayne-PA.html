<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>20. 20 Final Rule  OSHA published the final rule for Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training on December 1, 1998. The dual tires in the rear are as wide as the truck itself, and almost completely outboard of the body, so essentially it's like three trucks wide and three trucks tall coming at you.
