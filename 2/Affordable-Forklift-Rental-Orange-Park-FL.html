<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability.

Rental forklifts are maintained to Crown's high standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations.

Many of our long-term customers had their first exposure to the fuel efficiency, high productivity and ease of operation of Linde forklifts through their dealings with our forklift hire department.

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
