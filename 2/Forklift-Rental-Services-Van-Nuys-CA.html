As someone with no forklift experience, you will do between three and six days of training before you take the test. Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform with the axis of the load wheels parallel to the tilting axis of the platform.</p>
<p>Not only this, but a rough terrain forklift is comfortable and easy to service. A parking brake (or mechanism) shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
