<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>We sell, rent and service a wide variety of forklift makes and models. United Rentals deploys over $11.6 billion of fleet. The auto loan experts at our Dallas lease department will make absolutely sure you can get the best rates on any Chevrolet Silverado lifted truck. In 2000, OSHA issued an ergonomics standard. Dillon Toyota Lift's expert instructors offer forklift operator training and train the trainer courses to keep you OSHA compliant.</p>

From electric pallet jacks to narrow aisle lift trucks or sit-down rider forklifts, we'll help you find exactly what you need and get it to your facility when you need it. Any surface a forklift drives on must be able to support the forklift and its load with a safety factor of four. If you intend to go beyond a short-term rental, consider talking with your local MCFA lift truck dealer first to make sure you get the most out of your forklift rental.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>In addition to forklifts, we rent forklift attachments, aerial lifts, pallet jacks, sweeper scrubbers, and utility vehicles. In a factory setting, the electric forklift can operate all day on a single charge. 2. 2 Disclaimer This presentation is intended as a resource for providing training on OSHA's revised powered industrial truck operator standards.
