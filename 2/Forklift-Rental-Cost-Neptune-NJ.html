If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks 5 ft off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower.</p>
<h2>Electric Fork Truck Neptune</h2>

Please do not hesitate to give us a call, or send us an inquiry, and we'd be happy to help you find the right forklift for your business.</p>
