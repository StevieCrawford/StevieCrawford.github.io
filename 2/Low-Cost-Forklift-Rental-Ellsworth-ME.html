If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.)
