That's why we have forklifts and forklift parts for available. HIGH-LIFT TRUCK: A self-loading truck equipped with an elevating mechanism designed to permit tiering.

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.
